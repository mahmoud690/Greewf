## Green web framework!

A framework which automates and simplifies the process of converting old fashion web applications into Ajax based, Single Page Applications(SPA).

You just simply implement your web application as the way you did before and then you can get this views automatically: 
### SPA mode 
Modern Single Page Application. Everything is Ajax and the browser history is managed through URL bookmarks

### Multi-Tab mode
It is great when you have designed an enterprise application when users need to have multiple forms open at the same time inside one browser's tab!  

### Simple mode
It is exactly as same as you designed your web application. It is great if you need to have old browser support

- Server-side helper ViewEngine/layouting (based on Asp.Net MVC)
- Visual Studio Code Generator for CRUD 
- Inline and interactive file download
- SQL Server Reporting Service rendering helpers
